- For my UI automation, I used:
-- Cucumber for by BDD
-- Java Programming Language
-- Selenium WebDriver
-- Chrome Driver
-- To run the test, right click on the feature file and click on run

- For the api automation test, i started using rest-assured but I could not get the authorisation working. I tried:
-- Using auth.oauth (No success)
-- parsing the Oauth as a header but still did not work.
-- Tried encoding the Oauth before parsing it but still did not work

-- I have done my API tests in Postman
-- The data is change in Sandbox Trademe and that is why I am pushing my work.
